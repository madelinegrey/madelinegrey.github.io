					<h1>local natives cd cover design</h1>
					<h4 id="recitaltxt-1">for a while i listened to local natives's "When Am I Gonna Lose You?" single on repeat. at the same time, i finally gave in to the hype and started listening to a lot of k-pop. i had noticed that a not-insignificant part of k-pop culture was physical album releases, with special photocards of different members, lyrics booklets, and more. and then i watched this video from the 1975's frontman talking about the aesthetics of each 1975 era - how those aesthetic eras told certain stories about him, the band's music, his own artistic influences, etc.</h4>
					<h4 id="recitaltxt-2">so i had all of this in mind one day when i had a design itch to scratch. i began imagining what a physical album release for "When Am I Gonna Lose You?" would look like - a cd case that opens double-door style revealing lyrics inside the flaps, the words of the single's title in place of the band members among the bushes, and the bold typography of recent branding to match.</h4>
					<h4 id="recitaltxt-3">the three-image collage at the bottom are a few of the sources i referenced while creating this design. they include the <i>Violet Street</i> album art and two album art covers for their single release and acoustic version.</h4>
					<h4>in the future, i want to continue exploring design as it pertains to music and musical artists.</h4>
